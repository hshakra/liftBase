        <p>
          LiftBase is a small exercise database app that lets you browse
          exercises by muscle group. Pick a muscle (e.g. Chest, Biceps, Core),
          hit Search, and you get a set of exercises with category, equipment,
          and muscles listed. You can open full details in a modal or add
          exercises to your Favourites to find them later.
        </p>

        <p>
          Use the Home page to search. Each result card has a "Learn More"
          button for the full description, an "Add to Favourites" button, and
          "Add to Workout" to build a workout. After searching, you can filter
          results by name and equipment. The Workout panel (navbar button)
          shows your current workout: add sets and notes, reorder or remove
          exercises, then Save to store it under My Workouts. From My Workouts
          you can view, load, or delete saved workouts and see a muscle
          coverage chart.
        </p>

        <p>
          Favourites are stored in your browser and stay there until you
          remove them. Workouts are also saved in the browser.
        </p>

        <p>
          Exercise data comes from the WGER Workout Manager API. No account or
          API key is required to use LiftBase.
